# Stripe CTF Solutions
**Just what it says on the tin.**

## What?
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) held a [CTF challenge](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag) that ran for one week, February 22nd to the 29th. It was basically a series of pentests. These were my solutions to all of them.

## Why?
For posterity, mostly. I had a lot of fun completing the challenge, and even made some friends along the way. Now that it’s over, sharing our solutions lets us all compare our methods and learn from one another. Also, brag a little bit.

## How?
Each folder corresponds to a level. In them is the message of the day printed when you logged in, any associated files, and a solution folder with the steps taken to find exploit the level, and any associated files required for the exploit.

## To Do
* Add the alternate, magical level04 solution, and an in depth explanation of how it works.

## Credit Where It’s Due
A lot of the various improvements and implementations in level06’s timing attack, and the (forthcoming) explanation to the magical level04 solution are the result of my work with [Thomas Hebb](https://github.com/tchebb) and [Alex Yakoubian](https://github.com/alex3). We spent days bouncing off ideas to improve our timing attacks and stepping through level04 instruction by instruction to explain my magical solution. My work on the CTF would not be nearly as good without them.
